The needed files for the 1.6.2 developer environment of forge to work!

All of these files must be extract and put into "forge\mcp\jars"

In addition to that, you must download the server jar. It must be named "minecraft_server.1.6.2.jar" for it to detect and work. 
It must be put in "forge\mcp\jars". 

Download the minecraft server jar here: https://mcversions.net/download/1.6.2

You must also check "versions\1.6.2" for additional install instructions.

The last step you need to do is to go here: https://archive.org/details/assets_162_164 download the assets and extract it to "forge\mcp\jars".
It will not result in proper sounds if this is not done.

NOTE TO ME:
(minecraft_server.jar) does not seem to work even tho that's what is said in the docs??????
